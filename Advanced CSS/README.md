# Daily Learning Log - October 17, 2024

Today, I worked through the basics of **CSS Responsiveness**, including **float** and **display properties**. I found myself fighting the urge to skip through the videos, thinking, "I know it all." However, it has been refreshing to revisit these concepts from the ground up. Strengthening my foundational knowledge is important, especially as I prepare for future job opportunities, God willing.

A significant source of motivation for me right now is improving my brother's mobile car detailing website. I initially built that website during a weekend before going to seminary, and now I want to make it even better. Completing this CSS course, alongside my Python course, will help me enhance the website's responsiveness and bring it up to date.

I look forward to applying what I learn to improve my brother's site and refining my skills for future projects.
