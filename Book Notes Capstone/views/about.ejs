          <h2 class="mb-4">Why I Built This</h2>
          <p>This project was born out of a desire to be more intentional with my reading, and to stay motivated with a long-term goal in mind. It helps me track the books I’ve read, take notes, reflect on ideas, and build consistent habits.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Who's It For?</h2>
          <p>The project is meant for employers, portfolio viewers, and myself. I wanted a space where I could combine my love of learning and software development into something practical, presentable, and meaningful.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Approach to Learning</h2>
          <p>I’m not just generating code—I’m deeply focused on understanding it. That means it’s taking me longer, but it’s making me a stronger and more intentional developer. Every part of this app is an opportunity to level up.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Current Role</h2>
          <p>I’m currently working as a Program Director at an after-school program, where I lead a team and work closely with kids and families. This role has sharpened my leadership, empathy, and problem-solving skills—all of which feed into how I build and think about software.</p>
